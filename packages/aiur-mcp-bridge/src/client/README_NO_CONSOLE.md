# Client Components Console Output Removal

## Overview
All console output has been removed from the client components to ensure they don't interfere with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) stdio communication.

## Files Updated
1. **ServerManager.js** - Removed all verbose console.log and console.error statements
2. **ServerLauncher.js** - Removed all console.log, console.warn, and console.error statements
3. **ServerDetector.js** - No changes needed (already clean)
4. **WebSocketClient.js** - No changes needed (already clean)

## Rationale
When these client components are used by the MCP stdio server, any output to stdout or stderr can corrupt the MCP protocol communication. All informational logging has been removed or converted to comments.

## Important Notes
- All necessary information is still available through return values
- Error handling remains intact - errors are thrown or returned as appropriate
- The components remain fully functional, just without console output
- If logging is needed in the future, it should be done through a proper logging mechanism that doesn't write to stdout/stderr (e.g., file-based logging or a LogManager that can be configured)
