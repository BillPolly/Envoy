# Aiur Actors UI - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for building the Aiur Actors UI MVP. Each component and feature will be built by writing tests first, then implementing the minimal code to make those tests pass. The focus is on functional correctness only - no NFRs (security, performance, migration, documentation) are included in this MVP phase.

## Approach and Rules

### TDD Process
1. **Write failing tests first** - Define expected behavior through tests
2. **Implement minimal code** - Write just enough code to make tests pass
3. **Keep it simple** - Focus on correctness, not optimization
4. **Test at multiple levels** - Unit tests for components/actors, integration tests for interactions

### Development Rules
- All code must have tests written before implementation
- Tests must fail before implementation begins
- Implementation should be minimal to satisfy tests
- No premature optimization or extra features
- Follow the Design.md specifications exactly
- Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies in unit tests
- Integration tests should use real components where possible

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components, models, views, viewmodels, and actors in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component-actor interactions and multi-component workflows

## Notes

- This plan focuses solely on functional correctness
- Each step should be completed in order
- Tests must be written before implementation
- No features beyond those specified in Design.md should be added
- Performance, security, and other NFRs will be addressed in future phases
