# Planning Interface Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Planning Interface as specified in the design document. The implementation follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, writing tests first and implementing functionality to make them pass.

## Implementation Approach & Rules

### Core Principles

1. **TDD Without Refactoring**: Write tests first, implement correctly on first attempt
2. **No Mocks in Production Code**: All implementation code must use real dependencies
3. **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: Integration tests must use live components
4. **No Fallbacks**: Raise errors immediately, fail fast
5. **Unit Test Mocks Only**: Mocks permitted only in unit tests for isolation
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Every component must have unit and integration tests
7. **MVP Focus**: Functional correctness only, no NFRs (security, performance, etc.)

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions with real services
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows through the UI

### Development Rules

- All tests must pass before moving to next step
- Each phase must be fully complete before starting the next
- Integration tests use real MongoDB, real WebSocket connections, real services
- Error handling must be explicit - no silent failures
- Local running and UAT only - no deployment considerations

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests for a component
npm test -- packages/apps/tool-registry-ui/__tests__/

# Run unit tests only
npm test:unit

# Run integration tests (requires services running)
npm test:integration

# Run E2E tests
npm test:e2e

# Run with coverage
npm test:coverage
```

## Notes

- This plan focuses exclusively on functional correctness for MVP
- No consideration given to NFRs (performance, security, scalability)
- No deployment or publishing steps included
- All integration tests use real services - no mocks
- Implementation code contains no mocks or fallbacks
- Errors should fail fast and be explicit

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to building the Planning Interface with comprehensive testing at every step. Each checkbox should be marked upon completion of the corresponding step.
