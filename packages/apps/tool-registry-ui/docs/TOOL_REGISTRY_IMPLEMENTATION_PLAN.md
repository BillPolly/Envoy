# Tool Registry Browser - TDD Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation plan for the Tool Registry Browser application. The implementation follows the complete MVVM architecture specified in the design document (TOOL_REGISTRY_MVVM_DESIGN.md).

## Approach & Rules

### Core Principles
1. **TDD Without Refactor**: Write tests first, implement to pass, get it right first time
2. **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: All integration tests use real components and data
3. **No Mocks in Implementation**: Production code never uses mock objects or fallbacks
4. **Errors Are Explicit**: No silent fallbacks - all errors must be raised and handled
5. **Design Doc Compliance**: All implementation follows patterns in TOOL_REGISTRY_MVVM_DESIGN.md
6. **MVP Focus**: Functional correctness only - no NFRs, security, performance optimization
7. **Local UAT Ready**: Built for local running and user acceptance testing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual Model, View, ViewModel layers in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete component flows with real DOM and data
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every public method and user interaction path tested
- **Real Components Only**: Integration tests use actual Legion components, never mocks

### Implementation Rules
- **Zero Hardcoded HTML**: All markup generated by View layers (per design doc)
- **CSS Classes Only**: No inline styles anywhere (per design doc)
- **Responsive Units Only**: clamp(), vh, vw, rem - no pixels (per design doc)
- **Strict MVVM Separation**: Model, View, ViewModel layers (per design doc)
- **Umbilical Protocol**: All components follow protocol (per design doc)

## Notes

- This plan references TOOL_REGISTRY_MVVM_DESIGN.md for all implementation details
- Each checkbox will be marked with ✅ when completed
- Tests are written BEFORE implementation in true TDD fashion
- No refactoring step - aim to get it right first time
- Focus is purely on functional correctness for MVP
