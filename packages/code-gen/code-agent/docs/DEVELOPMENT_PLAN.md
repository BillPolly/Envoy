# Code-Agent Enhancement Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This development plan outlines the comprehensive enhancement of the `@jsenvoy/code-agent` package to integrate with `@jsenvoy/log-manager`, `@jsenvoy/node-runner`, and `@jsenvoy/playwright`. The project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach without the refactor step, aiming to get the implementation right in the first pass.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- Transform code-agent from mocked testing to real-world validation
- Integrate comprehensive log analysis and correlation
- Implement full browser automation testing
- Provide real server execution and API testing
- Create enterprise-grade development platform

### Success Criteria
- All tests execute in real environments (Node.js, browsers)
- Comprehensive log capture and analysis across all components
- End-to-end workflow validation with visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Zero-downtime migration from existing mocked system

## TDD Methodology

### Approach: Test-First Development (Without Refactor)
1. **Red Phase**: Write comprehensive failing tests first
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass all tests
3. **Skip Refactor**: Get implementation right in first pass through careful planning

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and data flow
- **System Tests**: End-to-end workflows and scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Load, stress, and benchmark testing
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability and penetration testing

### Testing Requirements
- **Coverage**: Minimum 90% code coverage for all new components
- **Performance**: All tests must complete within defined time limits
- **Reliability**: Tests must be deterministic and repeatable
- **Documentation**: All tests must include comprehensive documentation
