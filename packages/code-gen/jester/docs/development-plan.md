# Jester TDD Development Plan

This document outlines the test-driven development approach for building Jester. Each component will be developed using TDD principles without refactoring - we write the test first, then write the minimal code to make it pass.

## Development Guidelines

### TDD Process
1. Write the test first
2. Run test - see it fail
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Run test - see it pass
5. Commit immediately
6. Move to next test

### No Refactoring Rule
- Do NOT refactor working code
- Do NOT optimize prematurely
- Do NOT generalize early
- Focus on making tests pass

### Test Naming Convention
```javascript
test('should [expected behavior] when [condition]', () => {
  // Arrange
  // Act
  // Assert
});
```

### Commit Message Format
```
test: add test for [feature]
feat: implement [feature] to pass test
```

## Success Criteria

Each phase is complete when:
1. All tests are written
2. All tests pass
3. Code coverage is 100% for the phase
4. No refactoring has been done
5. All code is committed

## Notes

- Start with Phase 1 and complete it entirely before moving to Phase 2
- Each checkbox represents one test and its implementation
- Tests should be independent and runnable in isolation
- Use test doubles (mocks/stubs) for external dependencies
- Keep test files alongside source files
