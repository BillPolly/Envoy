# StorageBrowser Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach without the refactor step, aiming to get the implementation right on the first attempt. All implementation details are specified in the [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) document. This plan focuses solely on functional correctness for the MVP.

## Approach and Rules

### TDD Rules
1. **Write tests first** - Every feature starts with failing tests
2. **Test at all levels** - Unit tests for components, integration tests for flows
3. **No refactoring** - Get it right the first time based on the design
4. **100% test coverage** - All code paths must be tested
5. **Mock external dependencies** - Isolate components for unit testing

### Testing Hierarchy
1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual classes/functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions and Actor communication
3. **Functional Tests** - Test complete user workflows end-to-end

### Development Rules
1. **Follow the design document** - All implementation details are in DESIGN.md
2. **Complete each phase before moving on** - No jumping ahead
3. **Update checkboxes immediately** - Mark completed items with ✅
4. **Run all tests before marking complete** - Tests must pass
5. **Commit after each completed step** - Maintain incremental progress
