# PDF Signer Implementation Plan

## Overview and Approach

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach where tests are written before implementation code. Each component will be built incrementally with comprehensive test coverage, ensuring functional correctness at every step. The implementation will strictly follow the specifications outlined in the DESIGN.md document.

### Core Implementation Rules

1. **TDD Without Refactor**: Write tests first, then implement to pass tests correctly on first attempt
2. **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: Integration tests must use real components and actual dependencies
3. **No Mocks in Implementation Code**: Production code must never contain mock implementations
4. **No Fallbacks**: Errors should be raised and propagated, never silently handled with fallbacks
5. **Unit Test Mocks Only**: Mock objects are only permitted within unit test files
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Every component must have both unit and integration test coverage
7. **Design Adherence**: All implementations must strictly follow specifications in DESIGN.md
8. **Error Propagation**: All errors must bubble up with clear error messages and context

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation (mocks allowed here)
- **Integration Tests**: Test actual component interactions with real dependencies
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows from client to server and back
- **All tests must pass**: No skipped tests or pending implementations

## Success Criteria

The implementation is considered complete when:

2. All tests pass without any failures or skips
3. Test coverage meets minimum thresholds (80% for unit, 70% for integration)
4. Example applications run successfully
5. Complete workflows execute without errors
6. All error cases properly handled with clear messages
7. No mock implementations exist in production code
8. No fallback mechanisms mask errors

## Notes

- Each phase builds upon the previous phases
- Tests must be written before implementation code
- Failed tests must be fixed before proceeding
- Integration tests must use actual dependencies, never mocks
- All errors must propagate with appropriate context
- The implementation must strictly follow the DESIGN.md specification
- This MVP focuses solely on functional correctness
