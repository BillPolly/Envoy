# Plan Executor Debugging Tools Implementation Plan - MVP

## Overview

This implementation plan extends the existing Plan Executor with comprehensive debugging capabilities following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. We focus on adding four new debugging tools while leveraging the existing PlanExecutor core infrastructure.

## Approach and Rules

### TDD Approach
- Write tests first, then implement to make tests pass
- Skip the traditional refactor step - aim to get the implementation right on the first try
- Each component is built incrementally with tests validating behavior
- Integration tests validate component interactions with existing PlanExecutor core

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test each new tool in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test new tools working with existing PlanExecutor and ModuleLoader
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete debugging workflows and tool interactions

### Implementation Rules
- Reference the design document for architectural decisions and tool specifications
- Focus solely on functional correctness - no performance or security considerations
- Build tools in dependency order (simpler tools first)
- Leverage existing PlanExecutor core infrastructure without modification
- Validate each phase with tests before moving to the next phase

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- All five tools (including existing plan_execute) work correctly
- Step-by-step execution with session management works
- Interactive debugging with breakpoints works
- Plan analysis and validation works
- Execution state inspection works
- Integration with Aiur MCP server successful
