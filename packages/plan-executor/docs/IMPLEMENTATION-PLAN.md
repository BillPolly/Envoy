# Plan Executor Implementation Plan - MVP

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to build the Plan Executor MVP. We focus on functional correctness and comprehensive testing while referencing the design document for architectural details.

## Approach and Rules

### TDD Approach
- Write tests first, then implement to make tests pass
- Skip the traditional refactor step - aim to get the implementation right on the first try
- Each component is built incrementally with tests validating behavior
- Integration tests validate component interactions

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test each component in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test components working together with real dependencies
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete plan execution scenarios

### Implementation Rules
- Reference the design document for architectural decisions and component responsibilities
- Focus solely on functional correctness - no performance or security considerations
- Build components in dependency order (dependencies first)
- Validate each phase with tests before moving to the next phase

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Can execute simple llm-planner generated plans
- Emits progress events during execution
- Integrates properly as a Legion module
- Handles basic errors with retry logic

## Implementation Phases
