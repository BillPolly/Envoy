# Legion Planning Package - TDD Development Initiative

## üéØ Executive Summary

**The Legion Planning Package represents the next phase of the Legion AI agent framework development, applying the proven TDD methodology that delivered the production-ready node-runner package with 386 passing tests and 71% coverage.**

This initiative will transform the planning package from its current basic state (4 test files) into a world-class AI planning and orchestration system with comprehensive testing, seamless Legion ecosystem integration, and production-ready quality.
