# Intelligent Tool Selection Architecture

## Overview

The Intelligent Tool Selection Architecture addresses a critical limitation in the current RecursivePlanner framework: the inefficient practice of providing all available tools to the LLM for planning. This document outlines a comprehensive solution that dynamically selects only the tools relevant to a specific goal, improving planning efficiency, reducing token usage, and enhancing plan quality.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

1. **Overwhelming Tool Lists**: LLMs receive exhaustive lists of all available tools, leading to:
   - Increased token usage and API costs
   - Decision paralysis and suboptimal tool selection
   - Longer planning times
   - Potential confusion between similar tools

2. **Static Tool Provision**: Tools are provided upfront without considering:
   - Goal-specific relevance
   - Task complexity requirements
   - Contextual constraints
   - Dynamic tool discovery needs

3. **Inefficient Planning**: LLMs spend cognitive resources on:
   - Filtering irrelevant tools
   - Understanding unnecessary tool descriptions
   - Making suboptimal tool choices from overwhelming options

### Goals of the New Architecture

1. **Relevance-Driven Selection**: Only provide tools that are likely relevant to the specific goal
2. **Dynamic Discovery**: Allow additional tools to be discovered and added during execution
3. **Efficiency Optimization**: Reduce token usage while maintaining or improving plan quality
4. **Semantic Understanding**: Use natural language processing to match goals with tool capabilities
5. **Context Awareness**: Consider execution environment and user preferences in tool selection

## Architecture Design

### Core Components

#### 1. Goal Analyzer
**Purpose**: Extract intent, domain, and requirements from user goals

**Capabilities**:
- **Action Verb Extraction**: Identify primary actions (create, analyze, deploy, write, etc.)
- **Domain Detection**: Recognize target domains (website, database, file, API, etc.)
- **Output Type Inference**: Determine expected outputs (HTML, JSON, reports, etc.)
- **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate task complexity (simple, multi-step, complex workflow)
- **Context Analysis**: Extract environmental and preference constraints

**Example Analysis**:
```javascript
// Goal: "Create a responsive website for my portfolio with contact form"
{
  actions: ["create", "build", "develop"],
  domains: ["website", "web", "frontend"],
  outputs: ["html", "css", "javascript"],
  complexity: "medium",
  features: ["responsive", "contact-form"],
  context: {
    type: "portfolio",
    target: "personal"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Smart Tool Registry
**Purpose**: Enhanced tool registry with semantic search and intelligent filtering

**New Capabilities**:
- **Semantic Search**: Match goals to tools using NLP and keyword analysis
- **Capability Indexing**: Index tools by their capabilities and use cases
- **Dependency Resolution**: Identify and include tool dependency chains
- **Context Filtering**: Apply environment and preference-based filters
- **Usage Analytics**: Learn from successful tool combinations

**API Extensions**:
```javascript
class SmartToolRegistry extends ToolRegistry {
  async getRelevantTools(goalAnalysis, context = {}) {
    // Multi-stage tool selection process
  }
  
  async suggestAdditionalTools(currentTools, goal) {
    // Progressive tool discovery
  }
  
  async getToolsByCapability(capabilities) {
    // Capability-based tool retrieval
  }
}
```

#### 3. Tool Selection Engine
**Purpose**: Orchestrate the multi-stage tool selection process

**Selection Strategies**:

**A. Semantic Matching**:
- Map action verbs to tool operations
- Match domain keywords to tool modules
- Score tools by relevance to goal

**B. Capability-Based Filtering**:
- Use tool metadata for precise matching
- Consider tool input/output compatibility
- Apply feature requirements filtering

**C. Dependency Chain Resolution**:
- Identify tool dependencies
- Include complementary tools (e.g., read + write operations)
- Resolve transitive dependencies

**D. Context-Aware Refinement**:
- Apply environment constraints
- Consider user preferences
- Filter by available resources

#### 4. Dynamic Tool Discovery
**Purpose**: Allow tools to be discovered and added during planning and execution

**Mechanisms**:
- **Progressive Loading**: Start with core tools, add specific ones as needed
- **Reflection-Based Discovery**: LLM requests additional tools during planning
- **Adaptive Planning**: Modify tool set based on intermediate results

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Goal → Goal Analyzer → Tool Selection Engine → Smart Tool Registry
    ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓
Goal Analysis → Capability Map → Selection Criteria → Relevant Tools
    ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓
Planning Agent ← Tool Metadata ← Filtered Tools ← Smart Registry
```

### Integration with Existing Components

#### Planning Agent Integration
```javascript
// Enhanced PlanningAgent.run method
async run(goal, toolRegistry, context = {}) {
  // 1. Analyze goal to extract intent and requirements
  const goalAnalysis = await this.goalAnalyzer.analyze(goal, context);
  
  // 2. Get relevant tools from smart registry
  const relevantTools = await toolRegistry.getRelevantTools(goalAnalysis, context);
  
  // 3. Proceed with planning using filtered tools
  const state = this.initializeState(goal, context);
  await this._generateInitialPlan(state, relevantTools, context);
  
  // 4. Allow dynamic tool discovery during execution
  while (!this._isComplete(state)) {
    await this._executeNextStep(state, relevantTools);
    
    // Check if additional tools are needed
    if (this.needsAdditionalTools(state)) {
      const additionalTools = await toolRegistry.suggestAdditionalTools(
        relevantTools, 
        goal, 
        state.executionTrace
      );
      relevantTools.push(...additionalTools);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Planning Strategy Integration
```javascript
class SmartLLMPlanningStrategy extends LLMPlanningStrategy {
  async generatePlan(goal, toolRegistry, context) {
    // Get pre-filtered tools instead of all tools
    const goalAnalysis = await this.analyzeGoal(goal, context);
    const relevantTools = await toolRegistry.getRelevantTools(goalAnalysis, context);
    
    // Build prompt with focused tool set
    const prompt = this._buildFocusedPlanningPrompt(goal, relevantTools, context);
    
    // Allow LLM to request additional tools
    const response = await this.llm.complete(prompt);
    const plan = this._parsePlanResponse(response);
    
    // Check if plan requires tools not in current set
    const missingTools = this._identifyMissingTools(plan, relevantTools);
    if (missingTools.length > 0) {
      const additionalTools = await toolRegistry.getToolsByNames(missingTools);
      relevantTools.push(...additionalTools);
    }
    
    return plan;
  }
}
```
