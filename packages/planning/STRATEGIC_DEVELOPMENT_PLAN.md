# Legion Planning Package - Strategic Development Plan

## üéØ Mission: Production-Ready AI Planning System

**Objective**: Transform the Legion Planning package into a production-ready, comprehensively tested AI planning and task orchestration system using the proven TDD methodology from node-runner.

**Success Model**: Apply the same rigorous Test-Driven Development approach that delivered node-runner with 386 passing tests and 71% coverage.

## üìä Current State Analysis

### Existing Foundation
- **Package Structure**: Basic planner and bt-validator packages exist
- **Core Components**: Planner, Prompt, BTValidator classes implemented
- **Test Coverage**: 4 test files - minimal coverage
- **Dependencies**: @legion/llm integration, JSON5 parsing
- **Architecture**: Behavior tree planning with LLM integration

### Gap Analysis
- **Limited Testing**: Only 4 test files vs node-runner's 17 test suites  
- **Integration Missing**: No integration with node-runner or other Legion packages
- **Production Readiness**: Lacks error handling, monitoring, examples
- **Documentation**: Basic README, needs comprehensive guides
- **Real-world Validation**: No complex workflow examples

- [ ] **HealthMonitoring** - Monitor plan execution health

#### **2.3 Advanced Planning Features**
- [ ] **Parallel Execution** - Execute independent plan branches concurrently
- [ ] **Conditional Logic** - Support if/then/else in plans
- [ ] **Loop Handling** - Support iterative operations
- [ ] **Error Recovery** - Automatic retry and fallback strategies

### **Phase 3: Production Readiness & Integration (Weeks 5-6)**

#### **3.1 Comprehensive Testing Suite**
Target: 300+ tests following node-runner model:
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: 15+ test suites covering all components
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: 5+ test suites for complex workflows
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Load testing for large plans
- [ ] **Error Scenario Tests**: Comprehensive failure mode testing

#### **3.2 Real-World Examples**  
Create working demonstrations like node-runner's examples:
- [ ] **Simple Planning Example** - Basic task orchestration
- [ ] **Node-Runner Integration** - Complex process management plans
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Plans coordinating multiple AI agents
- [ ] **Deployment Workflow** - Integration with conan-the-deployer

#### **3.3 Documentation Excellence**
Match node-runner's comprehensive documentation:
- [ ] **Complete API Reference** - All classes, methods, examples
- [ ] **Architecture Guide** - Planning system design and patterns
- [ ] **Integration Guides** - How to integrate with other Legion packages
- [ ] **Best Practices** - Planning patterns and recommendations

## üéØ Success Metrics & Validation Criteria

### **Quantitative Targets**
- **Test Coverage**: 300+ tests across 20+ test suites
- **Code Coverage**: 70%+ statements, 65%+ branches (node-runner level)
- **Performance**: Handle 100+ step plans efficiently
- **Integration**: Successful integration with node-runner, aiur, conan-the-deployer

### **Qualitative Goals** 
- **Production Ready**: Zero critical issues, comprehensive error handling

## üîó Cross-Package Integration Strategy

### **Primary Integration: Node-Runner**
Planning system orchestrates node-runner processes:
```javascript
// Example integration
const plan = await planner.createPlan(
  "Deploy and test web application",
  [...nodeRunnerTools, ...deploymentTools]
);

const executor = new PlanExecutor({
  nodeRunner: nodeRunnerModule,
  deployer: conanModule
});

await executor.execute(plan);
```

### **Secondary Integrations**
- **Aiur**: Plans can coordinate multiple AI agents
- **Conan-the-Deployer**: Planning deployment workflows
- **Storage**: Persist and retrieve execution history
- **Monitoring**: Track plan execution across packages
