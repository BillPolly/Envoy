# Counter Example Application

A simple counter application demonstrating the Legion Server Framework.

## Features

- Server-side state management via actors
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Multiple concurrent client support
- Each client has its own counter (isolated actor spaces)

## Running the Example

1. Make sure you're in the server-framework package directory:
```bash
cd packages/server-framework
```

2. Run the example:
```bash
node examples/counter-app/server.js
```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080/counter

4. Open multiple browser tabs to see isolated counters

## How It Works

1. **Server Actor**: Each client connection gets its own server actor instance with isolated state
2. **Client Actor**: Handles UI updates and sends messages to the server
3. **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional messaging between client and server
4. **Actor Handshake**: Automatic pairing of client and server actors

## Architecture

- `server.js` - Creates the BaseServer and registers the counter route
- `client.js` - Client-side actor that manages UI and server communication
- `static/styles.css` - Application styling

The HTML page is automatically generated by the framework and includes:
- WebSocket connection setup
- Actor initialization
- Import rewriting for Legion packages
