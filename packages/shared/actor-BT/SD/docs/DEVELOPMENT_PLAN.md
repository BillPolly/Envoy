# BT-Driven Software Development Framework
## Comprehensive Development Plan - TDD Approach

Version: 1.0.0  
Date: 2024  
Approach: Test-Driven Development (Red-Green, skip refactor)

---

## Overview

This development plan follows a strict TDD approach where we:
1. **RED**: Write tests first that fail
2. **GREEN**: Implement code to make tests pass (aim to get it right first time)
3. **Skip Refactor**: We aim for clean, well-structured code from the start

**CRITICAL**: Each completed step MUST be marked with âœ… (green tick) when finished.
