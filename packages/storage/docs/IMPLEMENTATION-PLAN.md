# Storage Package Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for building the Legion Storage Package MVP. Each component will be developed with tests written first, followed by implementation to make tests pass.

## Approach & Rules

### TDD Process
1. **Write failing tests first** - Unit and integration tests before implementation
2. **Implement minimal code** - Just enough to make tests pass
3. **Run tests continuously** - Ensure all tests pass before moving to next step

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests** - Mock all dependencies, test components in isolation
- **Integration Tests** - Use mongodb-memory-server for real MongoDB operations
- **Test Coverage** - Maintain 80%+ coverage as defined in package.json

### MVP Scope
- **Functional correctness only** - No performance optimization
- **MongoDB provider only** - Other providers are future work
- **Basic operations** - CRUD + aggregation (no GridFS, change streams)
- **No NFRs** - Security, performance, migration excluded from MVP

### Development Rules
1. All initialization via ResourceManager (per design doc)
2. Dual access patterns: Direct backend + Actor-based
3. Provider interface must be fully implemented
4. All async operations use async/await pattern
5. Error handling for all operations

## Notes

- Each checkbox should be marked with ✅ when completed
- Run tests after each step to ensure nothing breaks
- Integration tests require MongoDB (use mongodb-memory-server)
- Reference DESIGN.md for all implementation details
- Skip NFRs (security, performance) for MVP
- Focus on functional correctness only
