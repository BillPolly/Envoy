### Added
- Initial release of the Umbilical Testing Framework
- Core infrastructure for component introspection and self-description
- Component Description Language (CDL) for standardized component contracts
- 7 comprehensive test generators:
  - DOMTestGenerator for DOM structure and event handling
  - StateTestGenerator for state management validation
  - EventTestGenerator for event emission and listening
  - DependencyTestGenerator for dependency injection testing
  - FlowTestGenerator for user interaction workflows
  - ActorTestGenerator for actor-based communication
  - InvariantTestGenerator for property-based testing
- JSDOM validation layer for real DOM interaction testing
- CoordinationBugDetector specifically designed to catch [object InputEvent] bugs
- Comprehensive bug detection capabilities:
  - Parameter passing bugs (including [object InputEvent])
  - Type violations and mismatches
  - State synchronization issues
  - Coordination bugs between component aspects
  - Invariant violations
- Quality metrics and grading system (A+ to F)
- TestOrchestrator for coordinating all test generators
- Detailed reporting with actionable recommendations
- 100% test coverage for the framework itself
- Example components demonstrating bug detection
- Comprehensive documentation and API reference

### Features
- Automatic test generation from component descriptions
