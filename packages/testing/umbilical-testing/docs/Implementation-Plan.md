# Umbilical Testing Framework - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach without the traditional refactor step, aiming to get the implementation correct on the first attempt. The plan focuses exclusively on functional correctness for the MVP, excluding non-functional requirements like security, performance, migration, or documentation.

## Approach and Rules

### TDD Methodology
- **Write Tests First**: Every piece of functionality begins with comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Red-Green**: Write failing tests, then implement the minimal code to make them pass
- **No Refactor**: Design carefully upfront to avoid the need for refactoring cycles
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both unit tests (isolated functionality) and integration tests (component interactions)

### Implementation Rules
1. **Reference Design Doc**: All technical details are specified in Design.md - this plan only references approach and structure
2. **Functional Correctness Only**: Focus solely on making the framework work correctly
3. **MVP Scope**: Implement core self-describing component testing capabilities
4. **Green Tick Progress**: Each step includes an empty checkbox to track completion
5. **Phase Dependencies**: Later phases depend on earlier phases being complete

### Success Criteria
- Framework can introspect Umbilical components and generate comprehensive tests
- Generated tests run successfully in JSDOM environment
- Coordination bugs (like [object InputEvent]) are automatically detected
- Integration tests validate framework works with real component examples
